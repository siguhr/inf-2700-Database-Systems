/** @mainpage A Tiny DBMS for Assignments in INF-2700
 * This project is used in the programming assignments
 * of the Database course INF-2700.

 * The DBMS consists of three layers: @ref pager.h "pager", @ref schema.h "schema"
 * and @ref front.h "frontend".

 * A database table, consisting of a sequence of data @em records (of fixed length),
 * is stored in a @em file.
 * Physically on disk, a file consists of a number of consecutive disk @em blocks
 * and the data records are stored in these blocks.
 * The structure of records are defined in the @ref schema.h "schema" of the table.

 * To process data in a table, the data blocks are read into buffer
 * @em pages in the maim memory.
 * A @ref pager.h "pager" provides the functions to work with
 * the pages.

 * The schema layer, in addition to maintaining the schemas of tables,
 * also handles table operations including
 * @ref table_display "display", @ref table_search "search" and
 * @ref table_project "project" of a table.
 *
 * A database user can run SQL-like commands through a
 * @ref front.h "frontend".
 *
 * Programming physical data management involves tremendous efforts in
 * memory management and debugging. For most of the data structures, you
 * can find useful @ref pmsg.h "printing operations" at your disposal.
 *
 * The @ref pager_profiler_reset "pager profiler" helps you investigate
 * the performance of various operations.

 * To learn how to use the pager, schema and record,
 * read the source code in @ref testschema.c and @ref interpreter.c.
